LINUX NOTES FOR FRIDAY LOLZZZ

0x00 LOGO


0x01 INTRO

* Linux and Linux kernel
* using Linux since 2004
* growing Linux community in tech team


0x02 WHAT IS LINUX

* family of open-source operating systems built around the Linux kernel
* typically packaged in a form known as a Linux distro


0x03 LINUX KERNEL

* world's most successful and important software project
* started as personal project by Linus Torvalds
* source code released in 1991 (26 years ago)
* licensed under GPLv2 (only)


0x04 MORE ON LINUX KERNEL

* Linux 4.14 contains about 23 million lines of code (C, header files, Assembly, JSON, build scripts, etc)
* over 14k developers from over 1300 companies have contributed since 2005
* 80% of developers are being paid for their work
* widest driver support, 85% of kernel code is in drivers


0x05 BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS

* RedHat, Intel, Samsung, IBM, SUSE, Google...
* Linaro organization focusing on ARM

* biggest pain points in past:
  NVIDIA and ATI GPUs, Broadcom WiFi chipsets


0x06 LINUX IS EVERYWHERE

* 100% of top 500 super computers
* 85% of cloud
* KVM is displacing other hypervisors
* Android has 90% of market
* IoT is dominated by embedded Linux
* network hardware, routers, access points, switches

* behind on desktops and laptops (3%)


0x07 LINUX IN SPACEX

* SpaceX uses a special fault-tolerant Linux kernel in Merlin rocket engines
* plus all their IT infrastructure
* it is also used in Tesla Motors

* Falcon self-destruct routines run in unpatched Windows XP ;)


0x08 LINUX IN ORGANIZATION

* Linode runs on Linux
* all our servers runs on Ubuntu
* few developers already switched to Linux

* we heavily rely on open-source


0x09 MAIN DISTROS

* Debian, Ubuntu
* RedHat, Fedora, SUSE
* Arch
* Android (fork of kernel + custom libs)
* BackTrack and Kali

* distributions tree: wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution


0x0A KERNEL: BRANCHES

* Linus' branch is mainline kernel
* linux-stable receives slower updates and less bug fixes
* linux-next is dev branch, merges all of developers' and maintainers' trees
* releases about every 10 weeks (sometimes 9, 4.15 delayed by 1 week due to meltdown)
* every now and then there is LTS release with supported for few years


0x0B KERNEL: MAINTAINERS

* every file and driver has maintainer
* subsystems have maintainers
* branches have maintainers
* developer -> driver/file maintainer -> subsystem maintainer -> Linus

* script identifies owners, so don't touch floppy disk drivers ;)


0x0C CONTRIBUTING: PATCHES

* most active open source project on Earth, an average of 185 patches per day
* source code is stored git
* changes are submitted in bite-size diffs over email to maintainers
* special email client configuration is required: no links, no compression, no attachments, just plain text
* IBM is doing builds, very little testing, because testing hardware is hard


0x0D OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS

* GIMP, Blender
* Firefox, Chromium
* LibreOffice
* KeepassXC
* Atom

* Quake 3 source code


0x0E VIRTUALIZATION

* VirtualBox, open-source hypervisor from Oracle
* WINE, compatibility layer capable of running Windows apps


0x0F Q&A
